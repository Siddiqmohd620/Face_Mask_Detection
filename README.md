# Face_Mask_Detection
The system employs a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model for mask detection, which is fine-tuned for high accuracy in classifying faces as either with or without masks. The model is integrated with OpenCV's DNN (Deep Neural Network) module to detect faces in the video stream using a pre-trained face detection model.
